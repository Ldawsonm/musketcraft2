Hello, if you're reading this, then you're interested in loading shaders on the modpack.

Unfortunately, the mod that normally supports shaders (Oculus) has not been maintained in months,
and crashes on startup due to the Distant Horizons mod. It is unclear when Oculus will update next, however there is a solution.

This folder contains development builds for 2 mods: Iris and Sodium. They are not necessarily stable builds, but they do work.

If you would like to use shaders in this modpack, then you must do the following:

1. Make sure Minecraft is not open
2. Disable the Embeddium mod
	- you can do this by disabling it in the Curseforge Launcher or in the mods folder
	- it is recommended that you disable it and not remove it in case the shader mods cause issues
3. Copy the Iris and Sodium JAR files into the mods directory

With this, you will now have access to loading the shaderpacks in the shaderpacks folder.
Enjoy!
